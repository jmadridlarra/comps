The goal of this paper is to research the technology and to implement real-time interactive media with camera motion tracking and to apply this to design communication. In this paper we discuss the possibilities and advantages of using computer vision and the limitations and points of issue that the algorithm of camera motion tracking has still in various design fields.},
